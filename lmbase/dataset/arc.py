Interface of the ARC dataset.

Dataset Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/ai2_arc

Description:
    AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset with ~7,787 grade-school level science
    multiple-choice questions. Divided into Challenge (harder) and Easy subsets.

Size: ~1.5 GB, ~7,787 questions

Configurations:
    - ARC-Challenge: Harder questions (1,119 train, 299 val, 1,172 test)
    - ARC-Easy: Easier questions (2,251 train, 570 val, 2,376 test)
    Config setting in code: subset="ARC-Challenge" or subset="ARC-Easy"

Splits:
    - train: Training set
    - validation: Validation set
    - test: Test set

Features:
    - question: The question text
    - choices: Multiple choice options (A, B, C, D)
    - answerKey: Correct answer letter
