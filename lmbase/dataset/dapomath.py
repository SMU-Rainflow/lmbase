"""
Interface of the DAPO-Math-17k dataset.

Dataset Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Math-17k

Description:
    A dataset of ~17,000 carefully annotated math problems with integer answers,
    designed for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) of language models.
    Created by ByteDance, Tsinghua University, and Hong Kong University.

Size: ~310 MB, ~17,000 rows (original), ~1.8M rows (expanded)

Splits:
    - train: Training set

Features:
    - problem: The math problem
    - answer: Integer answer
    - extra_info: Additional metadata
    - reward_model: Ground truth for reward calculation
