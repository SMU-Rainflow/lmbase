# Block-based persistence utilities
#
# This module groups records into block files named by a base key and an auto-incremented index:
#     {base}_block_{idx}.json
#
# Saving:
# - Provide a `savename` like "results_123" (base + id). The system selects the latest non-full
#   {base}_block_{idx}.json, or creates {idx+1} when full.
# Loading:
# - Given the same `savename`, the system searches {base}_block_{idx}.json files from newest to oldest.


class BlockBasedStoreManager:
    """
    Configurable block-based storage for JSON records.

    This manager groups records into multiple JSON files ("blocks") based on a common "base" name derived from the record key.
    Instead of storing all records in a single monolithic file (which becomes slow to read/write), it distributes them
    across `{base}_block_{idx}.json` files.

    Key Features:
    1. **Block-Based Storage**: Records are stored in files like `results_block_0.json`, `results_block_1.json`, etc.
       This prevents any single file from becoming too large.
    2. **Auto-Increment Index**: New blocks are created automatically when the current block reaches `block_size`.
    3. **In-Memory Info Cache**: A dictionary (`current_block_info`) tracks the content and status of the *latest active* block only.
       This optimizes memory usage by not holding the entire index in memory.
       The full index is persisted to `{base}-store-information.json`.
    4. **Sequential Access**: Designed for sequential saving without complex locking mechanisms (assumes single-writer or non-concurrent usage).
    5. **Tensor Support**: PyTorch tensors are automatically saved to separate `.pt` files, with references stored in the JSON.

    Naming and Keying:
    - Block filenames: `{base}_block_{idx}.{ext}` (e.g., `orders_block_3.json`).
    - Info filename: `{base}-store-information.json` (e.g., `orders-store-information.json`), keyed by block filename.
    - Record key: the full `savename` string is used as the key in block JSON (not parsed). Uniqueness determines whether a save is "add" or "update".
    - Base extraction: the `base` is the part before the first underscore in `savename` and decides which block family the record belongs to.

    Args:
        folder (str): Directory where block files and indices will be stored.
        file_format (str): File extension for blocks (default: "json").
        block_size (int): Maximum number of records allowed per block file (default: 1000).

"""History Buffer utility for memory-efficient state management.

Provides HistoryBuffer - a hybrid storage that combines:
- Hot data: deque(maxlen=entry_limit) for recent entries (O(1) access)
- Cold data: BlockBasedStoreManager for historical entries (disk-based)

Usage Pattern:
    buffer = HistoryBuffer(
        folder="records/market/price",
        entry_limit=100,
        block_size=50,
    )

    # Append data each round
    buffer.append(price)  # Automatically persists when deque overflows

    # Access recent data (from hot deque)
    recent = buffer[-1]         # Last item
    last_10 = buffer[-10:]      # Last 10 items (slice)

    # Access all data (hot + cold)
    all_data = buffer.get_all()  # Reads cold from disk + hot

    # Access specific index
    value = buffer.get(0)        # First item ever (from cold storage)

Memory Profile:
    - With entry_limit=100: Only 100 items in memory
    - Historical data: Persisted to disk, loaded on-demand
    - At 20,000 rounds: ~100 items in memory vs 20,000 without buffer
